- When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

i am not sure for this question, maybe i will come back later

- Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

manaully sync probably does helpful when a lot people contribute in the same project, and we need to understand the changes that other fellows have been made before apply all the changes 


-Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. when would you use one instead of another?

fork is clone the repo into user's account on github
clone is copy the repo from github onto the local computer
branch is copy the new repo on local computer
