it will help developers finding the changes they have just made to spot the cause of the bug

version control help the people to see the changes they have been made and also help them to reconstruct the process of their idea making

- What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

pros for manually save:
	easy to seprate the logical change between each save

cons:
	risk for losing works


- why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

maybe because Git is manually save the commit, and allow users to create a logical commit. On the other hand, Google Docs has no logical history tracking function, so cannot track all the files together.

- How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

we use git log to check the logical changes between each commits, and use git diff to see the changes in code in details.

- How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

if I know I can always scoll back to the working version, then making changes will be a fun attempt for me to do

- Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using git for?

I have no idea, but colorful terminal window is so cool!
